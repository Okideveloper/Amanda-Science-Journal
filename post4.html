          <h2 class="section-heading">Welcome back to my blog!</h2>
          <p>I hope you enjoyed my findings from last week, I collected much data with the help from an awesome group of
            testers! This week
            I am continuing the fun with a new group, focusing our user testing studies on mobile devices. We will be
            following the same procedure
            as last week just on a smaller screen. Throughout this testing, they will be provided the same mobile
            device,
            an iphone 7 plus.</p>

          <h3 class="section-heading">Testers Results</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Susan</li>
            <p>She looks over the homepage and clicked on <strong>Self-Serve Groom</strong>, but noticed shortly after
              this was not what
              she wanted.
              First off, this does not provide the prices for grooming services, only self-serve, she blurts out, "I
              don't want
              to bathe my dog!". I could tell with her long stare at the phone she was confused, next
              she locates the 'services' link in the nav bar. This is where she found a list with the correct
              link, <strong>Full Service Groom</strong> which leads her to the grooming prices.
              The following two questions she found easily by clicking the location tab in the drop-down menu.</p>
            <p class="picture-info">Picture below shows Self-Serve options</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/self-serve.jpg" alt="self-grooming">


            <li>Jon</li>
            <p>Jon used a similar approach as Susan, he saw the word 'Groom' on the homepage and assumed he would find
              the grooming prices. Not there! Next
              he proceeds to use the drop-down menu where he find's <strong>Full Service Groom</strong>, finding his
              answer. He than continuies to the next questions
              using the 'Contact' link searching for the phone numbers and hours. He finds the numbers easily, because
              they are
              located at the footer of the page like it is with every page, he gets annoyed
              by not seeing the hours.
              He than goes to the menu tab clicking the 'location' link finding the hours of operation. He told me "that
              should not have been difficult". <br>I agreed and said, "that's why we're doing this"!</p>
            <p class="picture-info">Picture below shows list of Services</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/services.jpg" alt="grooming-info">


            <li>Frank</li>
            <p>Lastly, we have Frank who has a different outcome. He clicks the menu tab right away
              and locates 'Services' from there finds <strong>Full Service Groom</strong> with the prices. Very
              Smart! Than he quickly goes to find the contact numbers by scrolling all the way down the page.
              Onto the last question finding the store hours, in which he struggles. He first goes to the
              online store, in the menu options which was interesting, than
              goes to contact. While on the contact page he notices it has no information pertaining to hours, just two
              links.
              He clicks on the phone number located at the footer of the page which highlights the
              section and diplays "Click here to view the map". He clicks
              again and finally it takes him to the store hours he was having so much trouble finding.</p>
            <p class="picture-info">Picture below shows highlighted section</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/footer.jpg" alt="phone-numbers">
          </ul>

          <h3 class="section-heading">Summary of Final Thoughts</h3>

          <p>My testers did an excellent job inspecting the Soggy Doggy Website using a different method than before,
            using a mobile device. I was able to gather new data and found ways the mobile version site can be improved
            and be better accessible to visiting users.<br>

            <br>I do have a few recommendation's that I believe would make the site easier to use and will not give
            users a
            chance to become confused. Starting with the grooming prices, both Susan and Jon had a hard time finding the
            grooming prices, they assumed it would be on the ‘Self-serve Groom’ page. This would be easily avoided if
            they would combine all services with the prices on one single page. This would avoid the users going on a
            searching party!<br>

            <br>The search for the contact information and the store hours were a bit messy as well. The phone numbers
            are
            located at the footer of each page but are barely seen by the wrong usage of font-color. Phone numbers that
            are small and the color white with a light background will make it hard to read. Another suggestion would be
            including the store hours in the footer, this would not take up much space. This would avoid users clicking
            multiple tabs trying to find an important key question that every user will be wanting to know.</p>
