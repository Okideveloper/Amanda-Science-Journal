          <medium><strong>Website Analysis:</strong><a href="https://www.thesoggydoggy.com/"><u>The Soggy Doggy</u></a>
          </medium>


          <h2 class="section-heading">Welcome back to my blog!</h2>
          <p>This week was a special one, I had the help from 3 friends a.k.a testers, accomplish a Usability test,
            while I sat
            back and collected data. I asked all my testers the same questions relating to a site’s functionality and
            accessibility
            for further review on its performance. I need to see how easy or hard it was for them to find the answers to
            my questions.
            With each tester experience, I will gain knowledge to learn if the site makes sense or needs further
            improvements to
            be more user-friendly.
            <p>Let’s begin!! But first, let’s meet the testers!!!</p>
            <h3>Ryan (my husband)</h3>

            <hr>
            <h2 class="section-heading"><a href="https://www.thesoggydoggy.com/">The Website</h2></a>


            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/homepage.png">
            <p>This website is a one-stop shop for all pet lovers. They have grooming, dog treat/food deliveries
              and an online store for mostly all your dog food needs expect for clothing. It is a local business with
              several locations, so being able to contact them is easy.</p>


            <hr><h2 class="section-heading">The Tasks</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Can you locate the Grooming price list? </li>
              <li>Can you locate the Store hours? </li>
              <li>Can you find how you would contact the store?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="section-heading">The Results</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Ryan</li>
              <p>In his attempts to answer the questions, he used the navagation for guidance. He did not stray from it,
                it took Ryan 2 minutes and
                11 seconds to locate the grooming prices. He relied soley on the nav sections for help and when he
                could't find his
                answers he started to get annoyed. Especially when the contact page had
                an error, he did not know how to proceed from there.
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/contact.png">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/contact-error.png">

                <li>Amanda</li>
                <p>She used the services section in the navigation first to find her prices, but oddly enough did not click on any of the grooming options.
                  She studied the homepage for awhile reading through the massive amounts of content until she clicked
                  on "Other Services". From there she saw the link Full Service Bath, she found this list in 1 minute and 19 seconds.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid" src="img/services.png">
                  <img class="img-fluid" src="img/other-services.png">
                  <img class="img-fluid" src="img/pricelist.png">
                
                <li>Evie</li>
                <p>Evie found the answers relatively fast, she did stumble finding the grooming
                  prices, like the other testers. She found the prices in 58 seconds! When she saw that the contact page
                  had
                  an error
                  she quickly scrolled to the bottom of the page and found the phone numbers, like she did with the
                  store
                  hours.</p>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Summary</h3>
            <p>It is clear to me, this site needs a remodeling! There needs to be a section for Grooming, including on
              that page a list of pricing. Too much content on a homepage can get discouraging and can push users to look
              for other services.
              The homepage has too much content for one set of eyes to handle, it should only provide it's main purpose.
               
              <p>My testers did a great job helping me 
              determine improvements needed for this site. Starting with the homepage, sections such as  
             the self-serve wash, self-serve groom and shedless treatment needs to be consolidated into one Grooming section. In
              doing so, they are giving the
              readers exactly what they want to know, that is how much and what grooming services are provided. </p>
