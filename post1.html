          <medium><strong>Website Analysis:</strong> Dr. Randall George and Associates</medium>


          <h2 class="section-heading">What is the purpose of the site? </h2>
          <p>In this website, Dr. Randall is an advocates for self-help and he is wanting to help people in a similar
            situation he was once in. Utilizing from his own personal experience, he has wrote a book and in need for an
            audiance.
          </p>

          <hr><span class="caption text-muted">Doctor Randall's motto, "You have to believe it before you can see
            it."</span>

          <hr>
          <h2 class="section-heading">What criteria are you using to analyze the site?</h2>

          <p>I will be comparing a similar self-help site to show you there are <strong><em>good</em></strong> sites
            that are legitimate and <strong><em>bad</em></strong> sites,
            that are scams or threats to your computer's safety.</p>


          <p>Here is the good site, called <a href="https://tinybuddha.com/">Tiny Buddha</a>. I am not saying this is
            the best self-help site EVER! This is
            <strong>NOT</strong> my goal. However, my goal is to give you advice on what to look out for when you are
            browsing sites.</p>

          <h3 class="section-heading">The bad:</h3>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/not-good.png" alt="not-clickable">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/bad-account.png" alt="create-account">
          <p>I can see a huge difference when comparing both self-help websites. My first impression with my
            working site is that it’s lacking
            design and that comfortable welcoming atmosphere we are wanting. His website is more of an advertisement
            for his services rather than expressing how he can help people. He created an Account page that wants your
            information but
            does not describe any details on the information we would be receiving. </p>

          <h3 class="section-heading">The Good:</h3>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/zen-woman.png" alt="zen">

          <p>The Tiny Buhudda site sends that authenticity vibe, it has working navigation headers with assumable
            clickable links. It also has recommended self-help articles for readers with specific needs or goals that
            are non-relating to the
            author. There is also a community forum and an account page that describes what kind of emails we would
            receive. Lastly,
            if you ever wonder about a sites creditbilty check to see if they have social media icons AND if they are
            clickable!</p>


          <h3 class="section-heading"><em>Also, listed below are a few criteria questions</em></h3>

          <ol>

            <li>Are navigational elements clear? </li>

            <p>I noticed he does not have a contact page but does list his address but with no contact numbers. However,
              he does list his personal number’s in his service page. They are clearly listed at the top and each appear
              to be functional. It does list common sections such as about us, team and his services. </p>

            <li>Do I know what I'm looking at on each page? </li>

            <p>His homepage at first glance is not professional. If were actively seeking self-help, I would not
              investigate
              his website or services. I do notice he has added a section with a summary about himself called About Us
              in the
              footer of every page. This is also repeated in his About Us page as the main heading. See below </p>

            <li>Is content presented with clear hierarchies? </li>

            <p>His message being “self-help" is presented clearly, in my opinion his approach screams desperate.
              His content is not structured well, meaning it’s all over the place, with no section headings
              expressing his goals. I feel as though I’m reading a children’s book with clumps of paragraphs, some of
              those not correctly spaced (see figure 1.2). He has some content highlighted and underlined making me
              believe
              it’s a clickable link, which in fact it’s not. He also lists a few questions for the viewers. See figure 1
              below.</p>

            <li>Can I see if there is more content if I scroll down? </li>

            <p>There is little content on this multi-page website.  He also repeats information already mentioned in
              other pages.</p>

            <li>What is working and what is not working currently on the site?</li>

            <p>The page loads at a normal speed has functioning navigation links. I did notice on his customer login
              page he has a
              Return to store link which does not direct you to the store but to the homepage. On the footer of each
              page has
              payment icons that do not function. See picture below.</p>

            <li>How could the site be improved?</li>

            <p>The site I am analyzing needs structure with headings on each page describing his goals. He needs to list
              his background
              and why readers should purchase his services. He needs to have a testimonial page because how can we
              believe he is
              not just a scam.

              <p>His site needs design such as bootstrap with informative sections that showcases his performance. It
                would also be nice
                to have a footer with social media links making him and his work believable. Also not add icons that are
                not clickable.</p>
